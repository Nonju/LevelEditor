Hi!

This program is a levelEditor made for creating simple
minecraft-like 2D levels saved in xml for use in other
projects ( or same if implemented ).

As of now, you navigate the first menus using your keyboard-arrows.
(RosyBrown-buttons)
Other editor-menus and settings are navigated with you mouse.
(LigthBlue-buttons)
